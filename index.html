            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits
                and comes in many forms. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public
                schools. Non-formal education is also structured but takes place outside the formal schooling system,
                while informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal
                education are divided into levels that include early childhood education, primary education, secondary
                education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like
                teacher-centered and student-centered education, and on the subject, like science education, language
                education, and physical education. The term "education" can also refer to the mental states and
                qualities of educated people and the academic field studying educational phenomena.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The precise definition of education is disputed, and there are
                disagreements about what the aims of education are and to what extent education is different from
                indoctrination by fostering critical thinking. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and
                improve forms of education. Fundamentally, education socializes children into society by teaching
                cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of
                society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems.
                Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies
                to determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International
                organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological
                factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status,
                ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to discrimination. Further factors include access to educational
                technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement.

                The main academic field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what education
                is, what aims and effects it has, and how to improve it. Education studies has many subfields, like
                philosophy, psychology, sociology, and economics of education. It also discusses comparative education,
                pedagogy, and the history of education.

                In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation. With the rise of
                ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from
                informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to elites and religious
                groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available. This
                increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became more
                important. This development led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all,
                free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age. Today, over 90% of all primary-school-age children
                worldwide attend primary school.</p>
